========================================
Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport
========================================

The Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport, Mosart,
is part of the Community Earth System Model.

IMPORTANT NOTE: MOSART is Obsolescent!

MOSART is part of CESM3, but is obsolescent.

We do not have support for creating input datasets for MOSART and
as such can NOT use MOSART for Paleo work.

Longer term MOSART will be removed in future versions of CESM and the new model
mizuRoute will be used for Paleo work as well as present day.
It's also possible that external collaborators will support the use of MOSART
for present day climate even as mizuRoute becomes the default model for CESM.
