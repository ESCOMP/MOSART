One-line Summary: major mosart refactor including addition of new halo capability

Removed all references to rtm

files have been renamed and namelists no longer contain rtm in the name

New modularity:

introduced new modules with new derived types and methods
mosart_control_type.F90
mosart_tctl_type.F90
mosart_tparameter_type.F90
mosart_tspatialunit_type.F90
mosart_tstatusflux_type.F90

the new modules modularize a lot of the complexity and variables that were previously found in RunOffMod.F90 and permit decomposition initialization to be more flexible and transparent.

New halo capability

Ability to have halo regions and communication using ESMF. This is needed for computing derivatives in upcoming new additions to MOSART.
New halo namelist - use_halo_option. When this is set to true halos can be activated. See the test_halo subroutine in mosart_control_type.F90 module.
Verified that the results for the halos are bfb identical regardless of the number of processors that are used.
-To set the values for the exclusive region that will be used in halo operations - you need to access the pointer as is done in the test_halo routine in mosart_control_type.F90:
     n = 0
      do nr = this%begr,this%endr
         n = n + 1
         this%halo_arrayptr(n) = this%latc(nr)*10. + this%lonc(nr)/100.
      end do

      call ESMF_ArrayHalo(this%haloArray, routehandle=this%haloHandle, rc=rc)
      if (chkerr(rc,__LINE__,u_FILE_u)) return

Issues addressed:
Fixes #93 "if (ierr /= PIO_NOERR)" will not be invoked unless PIO_BCAST_ERROR is explicitly set
Fixes #98 Change namelist items to remove "rtm" in the names of namelist variables
Fixes #97 Remove RTM in more of the MOSART code (filenames, subroutines, variables etc.)
Fixes #99 Add a new mosart_noresm testlist

One-line Summary: Remove MCT, some cleanup and high level refactoring

Removes all MCT references from the code and replaces them with ESMF routehandles and mapping calls
major changes to RtmMod.F90 along with other code cleanup described below

RtmVar
Now contains new ESMF data types needed for the MOSART mapping
       type(ESMF_Field)       , public :: srcField
       type(ESMF_Field)       , public :: dstField
       type(ESMF_RouteHandle) , public :: rh_dnstream
       type(ESMF_RouteHandle) , public :: rh_direct
       type(ESMF_RouteHandle) , public :: rh_eroutUp

RtmMod:
now have two new init phases for mosart. The first init phase is now called MOSART_init1 and replaces Rtmini. This has mostly what was there before but moves the creation of all routehandles to the second init phase - MOSART_init2 which must be called after the mesh has been read in. Also - moved the section of code for MOSART_init2 to be right below the section for MOSART_init1.
removed the mapping for Smatp_dnstrm since it was not used and there is no reason to create a map that is not needed. The associated code that was commented out for this has also been removed.
renamed RtmRun to MOSART_run
new indentation
MOSART_physics.F90
now using the computed routehandle rh_eroutUp
new indentation
Removed namelist variable do_rtmflood and xml variable MOSART_FLOOD_MODE. Also removed subroutine MOSART_FloodInit in RtmMod.F90 which was never activated and in fact the model aborted if you tried to invoke it.
Verified that this was no longer needed in consult with @swensosc.
masterproc -> mainproc
updated the MOSART testlist for derecho and betzy (betzy is a NorESM platform) and added a PFS test

Issues resolved:
  Resolves #65 -- Remove MCT
  Resolves #75 -- masterproc to mainproc

One-line Summary: PIO ascynchronus changes

Currently mosart initializes and try's to use IO in the advertise phase, but asyncio requires that this is not done until the
realize phase. This PR splits the mosart initialization so that the namelist is still read in the advertise phase but IO waits until
the realize phase. Tested with cesm prealpha tests on cheyenne, a modification was also required in the mct driver to handle the new

One-line Summary: Add nuopc cap for NUOPC coupler option

Add another driver cap for NUOPC in addition to the MCT cap.
As part of this rof_cpl_indices.F90 which was shared under
"src/cpl" was moved inside of the "src/cpl/mct" with "rof"
renamed to "mosart" since this isn't shared in between the
driver caps. The NUOPC cap doesn't use the coupler integer
indexes, only the character names.

A helper module for NUOPC ESMF functionality was added called
rof_comp_nuopc.

This also meant that nt_rtm and rtm_tracers was moved from
the rof_cpl_indices file to RtmVar.F90 so it could be shared
between the two caps.

Also to match the nuopc cap the import_export part of the
MCT cap was pulled out in it's own file.

Don't allow the namelist option rtmhist_ndens to be set to 2, because this

Fix for python3, using the floor operator for integer division.

Add in 8th degree routine file. Run pylint and check for py3 compatability.
There's explict setting of fill type. And also explicit use of shr_kind_r4 for 
kind rather than real(4), which is a better mechanism. Also ncd_getiodesc 
will read in PIO_DOUBLE for input xtype= PIO_DOUBLE or PIO_REAL. Most of this
is direct from jedwards4b (other than r8th addition).

One-line Summary:  Explicitly truncate the river length to a mininum value, rather than
                   just change the calculation of tlen for rlen_min.

Testing: Sean and Keith both ran long simulations with this change (in a branch off of 1_0_26)

Previous simulations showed that short rivers would accumulate water in them slowly over 
time. This doesn't happen in longer rivers. But it affects the total water balance of the
system. Simulations by Sean Swenson and Keith Oleson show that this no longer happens
with this change.

Changes from Sean Swenson to add minimum value to rlen (length of main channel); rlen values 
can be too small, leading to tlen values that are too large

M    src/riverroute/RtmIO.F90 - Explicitly set rlen to rlen_min early and remove code that was
        calculating tlen based on rlen_min when rlen<rlen_min. Since rlen is changed this affects code
        that is based on rlen, and can change the if statements that are triggered.

(2) Fixes the volr field sent to the coupler

Requires the cime changes from https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/pull/681

In order for the new irrigation changes to have an effect, also requires the CLM
changes from the branch
https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/clm2/branches/limitirrig - although this
code will work correctly without the CLM changes (in this case, irrigation will
simply be 0, and the irrigation flux will be folded in to a different runoff
flux).

Changes are from Sean Swenson; reviewed, tested and brought to the trunk by Bill
Sacks.

Testing: mosart test suite (on yellowstone), from
https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/clm2/branch_tags/limitirrig_tags/limitirrig_n10_clm4_5_12_r196

All tests passed, but with answer changes in r2x_Flrr_volr and x2l_Flrr_volr, as
expected.

Also ran aux_clm45 test suite; most tests passed; I'm looking into remaining
failures and will update mosart if it turns out it was the source of any
problems.

- modify the direct term and push all direct water to outlet points
- set all tracer 2 water (frozen water) to be a direct term
- add ability to skip some tracers in the euler solver via euler_calc flag
- add a budget accumulator term
- update history file fields and fieldnames, add new history fields

One-line Summary: update rtmini and rtmrun routine and add budget
- code cleanup of rtmini and rtmrun
- works with mosart input files with scrambled IDs
- moved dto term into rtmrun
- added direct-to-outlet tranfer capability
- removed a bunch of old rtm code
- fixed esmf interfaces and tested in DEBUG mode
- added budget calculation (still being validated)
- has a known exact restart error that introduces a roundoff
  difference at the first timestep at a handful of gridcells.
  This is probably not going to impact science, will be fixed
  next.
